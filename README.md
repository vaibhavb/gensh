# GenSh - Generate and Execute Shell
GenSh is a command-line tool that allows you to generate and execute code using natural language prompts. It leverages large language models to translate your queries into Python or shell code and then executes the generated code. The intenation of this tool is to assist in software and security research.


## Requirements
GenSh requires the following:
- Python 3.11 or higher
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 access)
- Anthropic API key (for Claude access)
- Ollama installed locally (for running local models)
- Dependencies (installed automatically):
  - openai>=1.0.0
  - anthropic>=0.3.0
  - PyYAML>=6.0
  - ollama>=0.1.0
  - python-dotenv>=0.19.0
  - markdown>=3.3.0
  - requests>=2.25.0
  - beautifulsoup4>=4.9.3

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gensh.git
   cd gensh
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```
   pip install .
   ```

## Setting up API Keys
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
To start the interactive shell:
```
gensh
```

### Command-Line Execution
To run a single command:
```
gensh -c 'generate_code "find your ip address" | exec_python'
```

### Prepare Templates for copying
To read inbuilt templates for processing by genai agents:
```
gensh -l book | pbcopy
```

### TODO: Batch Processing
To process commands from a file:
```
gensh -f example_batch.gensh
```

### Verbose Mode
Enable verbose output:
```
gensh -v
```

### Custom Configuration
Use a custom configuration file:
```
gensh --config /path/to/custom_config.json
```

## Configuration
Create a configuration file at `~/.gensh_config.json` with the following structure:
```json
{
    "template_dir": "templates",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "execution_timeout": 30,
    "max_retries": 3,
    "retry_delay": 1,
    "db_path": "gensh_logs.db",
    "output_format": "text"
}
```

## Development
To set up a development environment:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` or `poetry install`
3. Run tests: `pytest tests/`
